# Quizzler App
Welcome to the Quizzler App! This engaging application challenges users with a series of true or false questions. Test your knowledge and see how many questions you can answer correctly!

## Technologies Used
- Swift UIKit: The app is built using Swift programming language and the UIKit framework, providing a solid foundation for creating the user interface and managing user interactions.

- Storyboard: The user interface is designed using Storyboard, allowing for a visual representation of the app's layout and enhancing the development process.

- MVC Design Pattern: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is implemented to organize the codebase and separate concerns, making the app modular and easy to maintain.

- Timer API: The Timer API is utilized to enhance the user experience by introducing a time constraint for each question, adding an element of excitement and challenge.

- Progress Bar: A dynamic progress bar is incorporated to visually represent the user's progress through the quiz, providing feedback on the number of questions answered.
